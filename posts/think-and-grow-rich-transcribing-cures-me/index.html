<p>He does really great job and, no matter what it is, his book just shows me how to be the rich man in genuine term.
Just having a lot of money in material isn&rsquo;t a meaning of right form of Rich.
The Rich that I think is, Materially, and spiritually being free. Of course, Being free almost can be achieved by materially Free, by a lot earning of money. That&rsquo;s so true.
However, no matter how much do I possess the materialises, If I know how to be rich in spirituality, I can get the better life living. :)</p>
<h4 id="this-book-helps-me-how-to-deal-with-negative-mind">
  This book helps me how to deal with negative mind.
  <a class="anchor" href="#this-book-helps-me-how-to-deal-with-negative-mind">#</a>
</h4>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I am so glad to find this book.
I&rsquo;ve just wanted to fulfill my dried soul from this never satisfiable living. Desire is like a pot which isn&rsquo;t able to measure its depth. I didn&rsquo;t understand why I had to suffer with the negative thoughts. It&rsquo;s just tangled by the deep dark mindset. Even though I dreamed to be living in positive emotions, didn&rsquo;t know how to deal with those poisonous emotions.</p>
<h3 id="truly-worthy-i-hat-off-to-the-hill">
  truly worthy, I hat off to the Hill.
  <a class="anchor" href="#truly-worthy-i-hat-off-to-the-hill">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I should have to keep transcribing those quotes that shakes my emotions, into my note.
Whenever I find those quotes rooting down my heart, I feel to be cured.
I can understand why a person in introduction, claimed this book should be read in all over the American students in public school as a mandatory.
It&rsquo;s truly worthy reading.</p>

<p>Wanna build the place to make people happy.
Although there wouldn&rsquo;t be a physical place, I&rsquo;d like to make a platform where can people just simply visit-able, and find out what their souls get favors.</p>
