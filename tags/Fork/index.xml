      <description>Git was super difficult for me. #  but it took the time to get used with, inevitably.
The matter of fact is that I needed to upload public folder which is the projection for this hugo blog.
When I just able to upload the publicfolder to the gh-pages only, during wrapping up all git changes, I was the only way to seperately manage the hugo blog well.
the right way was subtree.</description>
