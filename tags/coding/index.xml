      <description>Error #   index.html:6:46&amp;quot;: execute of template failed: template: index.html:6:46: executing &amp;ldquo;index.html&amp;rdquo; at &amp;lt;resources.ToCSS&amp;gt;: error calling ToCSS: type  not supported in Resource transformations
 It was a bit time wasting. but the asset folder must be created in root folder.
Solution #  then the following lines worked.
{{ $sass := resources.Get &amp;quot;sass/main.scss&amp;quot; }} {{ $style := $sass | resources.ToCSS }} &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;{{ $style.Permalink }}&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Attention #  There is another asset folder in resource/_gen.</description>

      <description>Well, Still there are some things that I should have to keep learning. C Language, and shell are the things.

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ll get start to learn C language. #  Even I didn&amp;rsquo;t start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.
C language can be used in broad fields. #  As it&amp;rsquo;s called as a middle ware language, that can cover even in Embeded environment.
As I&amp;rsquo;m into permaculture, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.</description>

      <description>Git was super difficult for me. #  but it took the time to get used with, inevitably.
The matter of fact is that I needed to upload public folder which is the projection for this hugo blog.
When I just able to upload the publicfolder to the gh-pages only, during wrapping up all git changes, I was the only way to seperately manage the hugo blog well.
the right way was subtree.</description>
